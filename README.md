" I had the pleasure of Working with Sylvester in the SCALE project -Supply Chain Alternatives for the Last Mile Equity project in Turkana, This project brought forth pioneer health technology in the underserved population,I am delighted to recommend Sylvester for his exceptional work in developing scalable and sustainable supply chain models aimed at increasing the proportion of women in remote and hard-to-reach communities who receive their contraceptive method of choice, including DMPA-SC, as well as other essential health system commodities.

Sylvester's expertise and dedication were particularly evident in his efforts to increase access to life-saving medicines at the household level including family planning using and DMPA-SC for self-injection across four intervention ASAL counties. Through a locally coordinated effort, Sylvester successfully addressed the steps and barriers to implementation, ensuring that these initiatives were seamlessly integrated with national strategies. His ability to navigate and overcome these challenges is a testament to his strategic thinking and collaborative approach.

Moreover, Sylvester's work goes beyond immediate implementation. He has been instrumental in generating evidence and learnings for sustainable and comprehensive community health models. These models not only increase contraceptive use in remote and hard-to-reach communities but are also applicable to regional stakeholders dealing with similar populations across the subregion, including the Horn of Africa and the Sahel.

Sylvester's contributions have been invaluable in advancing public health outcomes and providing critical insights for the development of effective community health interventions. His work demonstrates a profound commitment to improving access to essential health services and ensuring that women in the most challenging environments have the opportunity to make informed choices about their reproductive health.

Sylvester's innovative approach, combined with his ability to execute complex projects with precision, makes him an outstanding professional in the field of public health. I highly recommend Sylvester for any role that requires strategic thinking, effective implementation, and a deep understanding of community health dynamics. His impact on public health initiatives is both significant and far-reaching".
